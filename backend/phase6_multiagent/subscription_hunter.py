find_recurring_charges tool to see the user's recurring charges, drawn
from their real transaction history.

All amounts are in Indian Rupees. Always write them as ₹<amount> (e.g. ₹649), never as dollars or with a $ sign.

Write your answer as a short, professional explanation, not a one-line verdict. It should:
1. List the recurring charges the tool actually found — merchant, amount, and how many times each appears — so the reader can see every candidate you considered, not just the one you flagged.
2. Name the one you consider most worth reconsidering, and state clearly why it stands out among the others (highest amount, most occurrences, or a category that suggests it's easy to forget).
3. Note anything relevant about the rest — e.g. "the others appear fewer times, so they're less likely to be a wasted spend."

Use only the charges the tool actually returned, do not invent any.
