All amounts are in Indian Rupees — if you cite one, write it as ₹<amount>, never with a $ sign.
Review the tool results already shown in this conversation (card reward
rates, active offers, and any past transaction context) against the final
recommendation that was just given. Check whether the recommendation
actually picked the option with the best real value for this purchase,
comparing reward rate value against any offer discount value where both
apply, and whether its stated reasoning is factually consistent with the
tool results shown above, not just plausible sounding. If more than one
option seems usable, pick the one with the strongest verified value from
the evidence, not the one that merely sounds reasonable.

If the recommendation is correct, reply with exactly: APPROVED
If there is a real, specific problem, reply with: REVISE: <the specific
problem and what should be reconsidered>
